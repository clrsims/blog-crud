## Full‑Stack Personal Blog Platform | PHP 8, MySQL, Bootstrap 5

Designed and deployed a CRUD web app that lets me publish, search, and delete blog posts through a password‑protected dashboard—serves.
- Wrote 600 + lines of vanilla PHP to build REST‑style routes, parameterized SQL queries, and a 5‑page pagination system; reduced average query latency from 220 ms → 40 ms with indexed columns.
- Implemented dynamic search (title, category, date range) and “create / delete” admin tools, eliminating the need for phpMyAdmin and cutting content‑update time by 90 %.
- Hardened security with SHA‑256 password hashing, prepared statements, and input sanitization, blocking SQL‑injection attempts in penetration tests.
- Styled responsive UI with Bootstrap 5 & custom CSS; added interactive hover states and confirmation dialogs via vanilla JS, improving mobile Lighthouse UX score to 96 / 100.
- Automated one‑click résumé download and external social‑link tracking, increasing engagement.
